<div id="about">
I'm from Stavies, a village that is located at the roots of the mountain Asterousia in the south part of the district of Heraclion on Crete. 
The 1998 i graduated from Highschool of Moires and after my participation in the National Examinations i was able to pass in the 
Agricultural University of Athens in the department of crop science. After that, i participated for second time in the National Examinations 
and i managed to introduce myself in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of National Technical University of Athens where i 
graduated at the year of 2007. Finally, i took my Master in Computer Science from the University of Crete at the year of 2014.
<br>
In the same time i have been an active member of cretan student union (FEK) and i took part in the production of many demonstrations, 
meetings and conferences. In my free time i learn about Computer Science, listen and play music, mostly cretan traditional music and mandolin, 
i play several PC games and i like to go for fishing. I served the greek army at the year of 2007, in the corps of Engineering.
